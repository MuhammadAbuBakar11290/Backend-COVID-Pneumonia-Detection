## Features

- Detection of COVID-19 and pneumonia from chest X-ray images.
- Integration with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
- Jupyter notebooks for experimenting and refining detection models.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/COVID-Pneumonia-Detection-backend.git
   cd COVID-Pneumonia-Detection-backend
